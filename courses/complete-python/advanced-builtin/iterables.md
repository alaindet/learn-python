# Iterables

## Definitions

- *Iterator*: Gets you the next value in a sequence
- *Iterable*: Allows you to loop
- *Generator*: It's an iterator that usually does not store values but "generates" them (ex.: a sequence defined via a formula, or reading some data in a stream)

## Notes

- Generators are iterators
- Not all iterators are generators
- Iterables are not iterators
